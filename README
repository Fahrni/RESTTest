RESTTest - Sample iFixit iOS REST app
=========================

* Created by [Rob Fahrni](http://applecorelabs.com)

What is RESTTest?
-------------------------

RESTTest is a sample iOS project that calls the iFixit Badges REST endpoint and displays the results in a table view. That's all it does.

It illustrates the use of 
* NSURL
* NSURLMutableRequest
* NSURLConnection
* NSJSONSerialization

Developed for my @NSSLO presentation May 1, 2012 entitled REST and JSON.
